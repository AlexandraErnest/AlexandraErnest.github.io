                    <p>You survive! As you are still bleeding somewhat heavily, you trudge to a nearby abandoned house, with the help of the two kids and rest for a while.
                         You form a strong bond with the kids over the many weeks they have been taking care of you and decide to continue your story with them in it. 
                         As soon as you get back on your feet, you and your newly formed group set off to go find what they have been looking for, a new place to call 'Home'.</p>
