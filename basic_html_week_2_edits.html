		<div class="p1" align="center" style="color:#6F6F6F;">
                I am an aspiring UI/UX designer and I have always had a strong interest in HTML. I was intoduced to creating websites in middle school and have been intruiged ever since.
				I started off as a Computer Science major and realized that I prefer the front end aspect of coding. 
				<br>
			  I heavily enjoy designing and making something innovative from scratch. I believe that HTML and CSS will be my passageway to doing just that.
